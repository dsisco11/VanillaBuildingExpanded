## Overview

**VanillaBuildingExpanded** enhances the building experience in Vintage Story by introducing tools and mechanics that make construction more intuitive and precise. The mod is designed to feel like a natural extension of the base game rather than a complete overhaul.

## Features

### Build Mode

Press the backtick key (`) to toggle **Build Mode**, then select a placeable block on your hotbar. The preview shows the target placement and orientation. Entering or leaving the mode displays a status notice.

Build mode stays enabled when you change hotbar slots. Selecting a tool, an unsupported item, or an empty slot suspends the brush and restores ordinary interactions; selecting a supported block resumes it. Mode starts off when you join and turns off on death. Snapping preferences persist across toggles within the session; held face offset does not.

#### Key Features

- **Block Preview Rendering** - See exactly where your block will be placed before committing, with a real-time ghost preview of the block
- **Orientation Control** - Cycle through available block orientations to place blocks exactly how you want them
- **Snapping Modes** - Multiple snapping modes to help align blocks precisely:
  - **Horizontal & Vertical** - Full grid snapping for maximum precision
  - **Horizontal Only** - Snap to horizontal planes
  - **Vertical Only** - Snap to vertical planes
  - **None** - Free placement without snapping constraints
- **Visual Feedback** - Invalid placement positions are highlighted in red, valid positions render normally

#### Controls

| Action                       | Default Hotkey         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Toggle Build Mode            | Backtick (`)           |
| Rotate Build Cursor Forward  | `R`                    |
| Rotate Build Cursor Backward | `Shift + R`            |
| Cycle Snapping Mode Forward  | `Middle Mouse`         |
| Cycle Snapping Mode Backward | `Shift + Middle Mouse` |
| Shift Placement              | `Shift`                |

**NOTE:** The _"Shift placement"_ keybind will offset the block placement position by 1 block in the direction of the block face you are targeting, this is useful for placing roofing or stairs, for example.

All controls are rebindable in the game controls settings. Backtick also opens WorldEdit in creative mode; rebind one of those actions if you use both. Brush hotkeys pass through while mode is off or brush use is suspended. Rotation passes through for blocks without rotation support; these blocks still support brush placement and snapping.
