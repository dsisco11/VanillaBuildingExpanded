## Overview

**VanillaBuildingExpanded** enhances the building experience in Vintage Story by introducing tools and mechanics that make construction more intuitive and precise. The mod is designed to feel like a natural extension of the base game rather than a complete overhaul.

## Features

### 🔨 Build Hammer

The **Build Hammer** is the core tool introduced by this mod. It provides builders with precise control over block placement through an advanced preview and snapping system.

#### Using the build hammer

Simply place the build hammer in your off-hand and then switch to a placeable block on your hotbar. The build preview will instantly appear!

#### Key Features

- **Block Preview Rendering** - See exactly where your block will be placed before committing, with a real-time ghost preview of the block
- **Orientation Control** - Cycle through available block orientations to place blocks exactly how you want them
- **Snapping Modes** - Multiple snapping modes to help align blocks precisely:
  - **Horizontal & Vertical** - Full grid snapping for maximum precision
  - **Horizontal Only** - Snap to horizontal planes
  - **Vertical Only** - Snap to vertical planes
  - **None** - Free placement without snapping constraints
- **Visual Feedback** - Invalid placement positions are highlighted in red, valid positions render normally

#### Crafting

The Build Hammer can be crafted using simple materials available early in the game, just a log and a stick.
Simply place a log above a stick in the crafting grid to create a Building Hammer.

#### Controls

| Action                       | Default Hotkey         |
| ---------------------------- | ---------------------- |
| Rotate Build Cursor Forward  | `R`                    |
| Rotate Build Cursor Backward | `Shift + R`            |
| Cycle Snapping Mode Forward  | `Middle Mouse`         |
| Cycle Snapping Mode Backward | `Shift + Middle Mouse` |
| Shift Placement              | `Shift`                |

**NOTE:** The _"Shift placement"_ keybind will offset the block placement position by 1 block in the direction of the block face you are targeting, this is useful for placing roofing or stairs, for example.
